*** Requirements ***
jQuery_update 6.x-2.0-alpha1 - http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update
libraries:
    https://github.com/christianv/jquery-lifestream

*** Optional ***
Timeago - http://drupal.org/project/timeago
This module is optional but highly recommended as it converts the iso 8601
dates to friendly date strings e.g. 4 days ago

*** Installation ***
1. Download and extract the Social River module to your modules folder
2. Download the jQuery lifestream plugin from
   https://github.com/christianv/jquery-lifestream
   extract and then copy the jquery.lifestream.js file to the js folder
   within the social_river folder
3. If you have not yet installed the jQuery Update module (6.x-2.0-alpha1)
   do so now and enable the module.
4. Enable the Social River Module
5. Go to Administer > Site configuration > Social River  and set the
   Feed limit (amount of feed items to show) and enable the services
   you wish to allow.
6. Got Administer > Site building > Blocks and set the social river block
   to display in the region of your choice.
7. Go to "My account" and edit your profile - you will see a tab for
   social river - click on that and set your username for the
   services you wish to display. (certain services require usernames,
   while others like Facebook page feeds require Page id's)
